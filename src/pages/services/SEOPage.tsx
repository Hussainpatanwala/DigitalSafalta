      whatItIs="SEO (Search Engine Optimisation) is the process of improving your website so that Google ranks it higher for searches related to your business. Better rankings mean more people see your website, more visits, and more customers — without paying for ads."
      whyItMatters="Over 90% of clicks on Google go to the first page. If you're not there, you're invisible to most of your potential customers. And unlike paid ads, good SEO compounds over time — the rankings you build this year keep bringing customers next year."

          answer: "Honest answer: 3-6 months for meaningful results, sometimes longer for competitive keywords. Month 1-2 is foundation work. Month 3-4 you start seeing movement. Month 5-6 is when results become significant. We track and report progress every month.",

          question: "Is local SEO different from regular SEO?",
          answer: "Yes. Local SEO focuses on 'near me' searches and location-specific queries like 'digital marketing agency Pune'. It involves your Google Business Profile, local citations, and locally-relevant content. For a Pune business, local SEO is often more valuable than ranking nationally.",

        {
          question: "What's the difference between SEO and Google Ads?",
          answer: "Google Ads puts you at the top immediately but you pay for every click. SEO takes time but is 'free' once you rank — you get clicks without paying per visit. Most businesses benefit from both: ads for immediate results, SEO for long-term compounding.",

          question: "Can you guarantee first page rankings?",

        {
          question: "Do I need a blog for SEO?",
          answer: "Not necessarily — but content helps. Blog articles that answer questions your customers search for can bring in significant organic traffic over time. We'll advise on whether content is the right investment for your specific business.",
